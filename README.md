Hi folks, I'm Soundarya Venkataraman, originally from India and currently based in Halifax, where I've been living for the past three years. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, which I completed in 2018. With 3.5 years of experience as a Software Developer, I’ve worked extensively with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, IBM DB2, MySQL, and React. After taking arounf 1 year career break due to health reasons, I’m now recharged and ready to dive back into the tech world with renewed focus and energy. I’m known for being a quick learner and someone who doesn’t give up easily—qualities that have helped me navigate both personal and professional challenges. Outside of work, I enjoy drawing and relaxing by watching videos of ceramic cup and pottery making—there's something really calming about seeing things take shape with just hands and clay. I'm now looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my tech journey!

I'm interested in building a career in Data Analytics, and I believe Python is essential for that. I’m currently focusing on learning Python and related front-end tools to create interactive data applications. I'm also interested in understanding DevOps, as it’s important for streamlining development and deployment processes.

Fun Fact: I find watching videos of pottery and ceramic cup making incredibly relaxing—it’s like therapy without the price tag!
